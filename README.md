# burger
----Heroku deployment not working so a gif showing it working is in the gif folder above----
Here's an app that takes a selection of burgers from a database and let's you eat one, placing it in the devoured category. You can also select from the ones that have been devoured to make a new one. There's a creation field at the bottom which lets you create a new burger to place among the other burgers as well.
